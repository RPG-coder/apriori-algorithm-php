# Apriori Algorithm (Mid-project)
#### By Rahul Gautham Putcha - Under the guidence of Prof. Jason Wang

## Setting up the Environment
- Install Xaamp for Windows, Linux or Mac
- MySQL/MariaDB is required for setting up a database. Xaamp Installs MySQL
- Setup the root for MySQL and start Xaamp
- Run Apache and MySQL
- Open Browser and view the page as part of the localhost


## Project Details (Apriori algorithm)
- Apriori Algorithm: describes that the superset of infrequent sets are always infrequent. Or we can say that group of items are frequent only if the individual items within the group are frequently picked. This approach is the best way to reduce the size of the set and make the process of finding the frequent itemsets to be more efficient.

- By the end of this assignment we would also get a set of association rules by which we can confidently say which items are bought together. Hence, Apriori is one of the best approach for building shopping recommendations system.
